# RecyclerViewAndCardViewProject

This is RecyclerView in Andoid Development. 
If your app needs to display a scrolling list of elements based on large data sets (or data that frequently changes), 
you should use RecyclerView.
If you'd like to create a list with cards then use CardView with RecyclerView.
